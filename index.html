<center><font size = '30'>The golden period of Classical music existed from the baroque period till the modern period, with varying styles and different composers, who brought their own ideas and visualized their concept of music,<br> 
from the divine bach to the Humanistic clarity of mozart, the heartwrenching beethoven, the works of the romantic tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff and<br> 
finally the modern minds of the beautiful Debussy and Prokofiev<br>

while classsical music existed before the baroque and after the modern period, it is the golden age of classical musical that we will be looking into,<br>
from notable composers from era and their works, the ones who created music the world has never known<br>
and probably never again.<br><br>
